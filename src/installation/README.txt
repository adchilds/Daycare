1. Getting Started

    i. Introduction
Welcome to Daycare Management System. This application has been designed to enable you to easily keep record of children, parents, and employees in your childcare business. Daycare Management System essentially enables you to keep virtual copies of all paper records from your business. The advantages to using this software is that all your paper records will permanently be stored virtually "forever" on your computer in a localized format without the risk of ever losing or misplacing the data (an obvious risk that comes along with keeping hard copy records).

    ii. Starting the program
Daycare Management System is packaged and deployed in the *.jar file format. This format is a Java Archive file which packages the needed source files and the Java Virtual Machine into a single executable file. In order to run this software, the user must have properly installed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on their computer. Java can be installed for free by visiting Oracle's website at (without the quotes): "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre-7u2-download-1377135.html". Modern day operating systems usually package the JRE on the system, so most likely Java has already been installed on your system. If however it has not, please take the time to download and install the JRE in order to properly execute this software.

    iii. Maneuvering throughout the software
This software has been created with the easiest possible graphical user interface. Maneuvering the software is as easy as clicking the buttons presented on the screen. The user does not in any way need to interface with the command line to operate this software. We will go into more detail on how to work different aspects of the software; however, it's important to note that everything can be done with the click of a button.

2. Children

    i. Adding a new child
In order to add a new child to the daycare database, the user may begin by selecting the Add New Child icon on the toolbar. Alternatively, the user may select the menubar items File -> New-> Child. Next, the user needs to provide information to the system by filling out the form that opens. The only required information is the child's first and last name, as this is how the file will be saved on the user's computer. Children files are saved in the Children directory of the main directory for the program. Files are saved as an XML file, in the format of 'lastname_firstname.xml'.

    ii. Removing a child
To remove a child from your database, for whatever reason you may need to do so, the user needs to enter the entire database view. When the correct database is loaded showing the table of all individuals within that database, the user may simply click on the name of the individual that they're removing from the database and then click the 'Delete Selected Child' button, located in the top right hand corner of the database view toolbar.

    iii. Viewing all children information
To view all information about all children in the user's database, you must click the 'Database' icon in the toolbar and then further select the 'Children' button. Alternatively, the user may do the equivalent: click in the menubar File -> View -> Database -> Children.

    iv. Viewing individual child information
User's may view an individual child's information by selecting the following options in the menubar: File -> Open... -> Child. Alternatively, the user may open an individual child's file by clicking the Open XML File button on the toolbar.

    v. Editing child information
If the user wishes to edit a child's information, they may do so by opening the child's individual file, as noted in section 'iv.' of the README. Next, the user should enable edits by clicking the 'Edit Child' button in the top right corner of the frame. After finishing edits, the user should then click the 'Save Changes' button, also located in the top right corner of the frame. Changes should now have safely been changed.
